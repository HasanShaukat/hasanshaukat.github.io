  desc: I'm Hasan Shaukat. I was born in Karachi. I'm a Data Scientist with experience in natural language processing, reinforcement learning, mathematical modelling and embedded systems.After graduating from high school, I studied Electronics Engineering at the NED University of Engineering and Technology. I got the 5th position among 152 students of the Department of Electronics Engineering. I also took part in a national robotics competition and achieved 7th in the first round among 47 teams from all over the country. And in my final year I worked at the Research Center for Artificial Intelligence at the university with the bachelor thesis "Design and Development of a 3D Ice Cream Printer". And after university, I took online courses in Mathematics for Machine Learning from Imperial College London and Deep Learning from Deeplearning.ai.My first data science experience was as a Data Analyst. I then worked as an AI developer and currently work as a Data Scientist at Mikaels Labs. I have been working in the data science domain for about 2 years and during this time I have learned data analysis, modern reinforcement learning, deep learning and machine learning API development. My further experience includes instrumentation in the oil and gas sector as well as research and product development in 3D printing. I can also speak, understand and write fluent German and English. I like playing video games and sports, watching movies and reading tech news. I also watch anime.  # Describe yourself.
